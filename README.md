# NimbleLocalAuthentication

![Tests](https://github.com/nimblehq/local-authentication-ios/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=develop)

The basic idea of NimbleLocalAuthentication is that we want to wrap the LocalAuthentication framework. Developer can easily authenticate users biometrically or with a passphrase.

Some awesome features of NimbleLocalAuthentication:

- Support enable or disable the biometric feature on the application.
- Easy to localized strings on biometric screens.

You can check out more about the SDK in [this document](https://nimblehq.github.io/local-authentication-ios) generated by [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy)

## Sample projects

We have a sample project in the repository. To use it, download the repo, run `pod install` in Example folder to download the required libraries and open [Example.xcworkspace](https://github.com/nimblehq/local-authentication-ios/tree/main/Example/Example.xcworkspace).

## Installation

For `NimbleLocalAuthentication`, use the following entry in your Podfile:

```rb
pod 'NimbleLocalAuthentication', '~> 1.0'
```

Then run `pod install`

## Usage

Using `NimbleLocalAuthentication` is really simple. You can access an API like this:

```swift
let biometryService: BiometryService = NimbleLocalAuthenticator()

biometryService.authenticate { [weak self] result in
  DispatchQueue.main.async {
    switch result {
    case .success:
      // do something after authenticate successfully
    case .failure(let error):
      // hackers are trying to authenticate :D
    }
  }
}
```
